LunchMaster is a simple lunch-organizing tool geared toward coworkers who get together for lunch most days, but sometimes pack lunch, sometimes want to go out to eat, sometimes have other plans, etc.

This is the first version of LunchMaster that I created back in 1999 as a Python CGI script, before I reimplemented it later using Zope (http://zope.org/).  I decided to upload it here partly as a historical record of what web development was like at a point in time, and also to provide a relatively simple example of creating a Python CGI script.
